Building
========
To build you will need:

 * A Java compiler compatible with Java 1.8
 * The Android SDK with platform 26 installed
 Building from command-line
--------------------------
> Note: at the time of this writing, the current version of Gradle ([4.5.1](https://gradle.org/releases/)) is not compatible with the current version of JDK ([9.0.4](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html)). To have the build succeed, use JDK version [1.8.0_162](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
